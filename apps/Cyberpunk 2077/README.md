## Notes on usage

These tiles only work if you create a shortcut directly to the application. If you are using Steam, you will need to manually find the `.exe` file, typically located in your Steam folder under the sub-path `\steamapps\common\Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64`.

The shortcuts that Steam creates are actually `.url` files that execute a custom URI scheme. You can read more about how those work [on this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/app-resources/uri-schemes).
