# What is this?

We've had the ability for applications to have fancy tiles in Windows since 2012, but most app makers completely fail to take advantage of this opportunity for branding. I got tired of seeing my start menu filled with Windows 95 style icons mixed in with a few fancy tiles, so I started creating custom tiles and decided to share them here.
