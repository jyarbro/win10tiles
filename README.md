# What is this?

We've had the ability for applications to have fancy tiles in Windows since 2012, but most app makers completely fail to take advantage of this opportunity for branding. I got tired of seeing my start menu filled with Windows 95 style icons mixed in with a few fancy tiles, so I started creating custom tiles and decided to share them here.

# Requesting tiles

I love making tiles. Please reach out to me either through the issues tab above, or by emailing me.<sup>[[1]](#footnotes)

# License, sponsorship, officialness, support

Every logo in this library is owned by the respective trademark holder. I have received absolutely zero approval or support to create these tiles from any of the respective application owners, and the existence of a tile in this repository is in no way supported by the trademark owner.

Where possible, I stayed true to the branding. When an application or website has a specific color pallete, I attempt to use that.

If you are a trademark holder or application owner for one of these applications, and disapprove of the tiles I've created for your application, please submit an issue to this repository, email me<sup>[[1]](#footnotes), or a pull request with updated tile images you'd prefer.
